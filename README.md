I care about preserving knowledge, language learning, self-hosting, and libre software.

My currently hobby focus is around improving my writing workflow and building up to learning how to make my own terminal web browser from scratch, like Ladybird.

* (Zig) (Go) [Commmand line argument parsing from scratch in different languages](https://github.com/yueleshia/cmdtree)
* (Rust) [DSL for hotkey management](https://github.com/yueleshia/chordscript) with a [demo website]()
* (Rust) (Zig) [Programming language for blog writing](https://github.com/yueleshia/tetra). A non-recursive hand-rolled parser and compiler that tries to preallocate the memory. Trying to replace Juypter notebooks.
* (Rust) [Static site generation with Tetra](https://github.com/yueleshia/polyglot)
* (Rust) [POSIX shell](https://github.com/yueleshia/rust-shell) just for fun

Miscellaneous:

* [Linux dotfiles with Nix but without NixOS](https://github.com/yueleshia/dotfiles)
* [Learning from scratch links](https://github.com/yueleshia/from-scratch)
